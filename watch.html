    <p id = "intro">The goal of casual conversation is to make people more comfortable around each other. <br>
    	If people are comfortable with each other, they're more open to conversation as the rapport 
    	between them increases. <br>
    	Therefore, generally, you want to avoid controversial or highly-specific topics until you have a higher level of rapport. <br>
		This simulation consists of 2 classmates talking one morning before class, and assumes the conversants only know <br>
	    each other casually, so for now you are only able to "discuss" benign topics. </p>
